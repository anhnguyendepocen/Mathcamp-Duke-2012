1) Prove that log(x/y) = log(x) - log(y)



R Excercises:

1) Calculate the sum n, j=1, j^2 and compare with n(n+1)(2n+1)/6 for n=200, 400, 600, 800

2) calculate the sum sum, i=1 to N 1/i, and compare with ln(N)+.6

3) Using rep() and seq() create the vecotrs

0 0 0 0 0  1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 4 
1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5 2 3 45 6 3 4 5 6 7 4 5 6 7 8 5 6 7 8 9

4) What does the command 'options()' do?  Give one example for how you might use it.

5) 

a) Use the text editor to crate af ile consisting of the line:

randomdata<-c(64, 38, 97, 88, 24, 14, 104, 83)

Save it to a file called randomdata

b) Source the file randomdata into R and confirm the randomdata vector was crated

6) Create a vector called numbers wich contains

3 5 8 10 12 

Dump numbers to a file called numbers.R and delte numbers using the rm() function.  using ls(), confim that number has beeen delted.
Now, use the source command to retrieve the vector numbers.

7) Find out how to use the function: factorial(), choose()
Write a sentence explaining what they do.
